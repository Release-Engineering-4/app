        Link phishing, also known as phishing through malicious links, 
        involves cyberattacks where attackers send deceptive emails or messages 
        containing links to fraudulent websites. These sites mimic legitimate platforms to 
        trick users into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, 
        or credit card numbers.
